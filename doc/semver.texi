@chapter Overview of the package


This document describes version @value{VERSION} of @value{PACKAGE}, a C
language library implementing semantic versioning for the C language.

@value{PACKAGE} installs the single header file @file{semver.h}.  All
the function names in the @api{} are prefixed with @code{semver_}; all
the constant names are prefixed with @code{SEMVER_}; all the type names
are prefixed with @code{semver_} and suffixed with @code{_t}.

@section Linking code with the library


This package installs a data file for @command{pkg-config}, so when
searching for the installed library with the @gnu{} Autotools, we can
add the following macro use to @file{configure.ac}:

@example
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBSV],[libsv >= 3.1])
@end example

@noindent
which will set the variables @code{LIBSV_LIBS} and @code{LIBSV_CFLAGS}.

Alternatively we can use the raw @gnu{} Autoconf macros:

@example
AC_CHECK_LIB([libsv],[semver_ctor],,
  [AC_MSG_FAILURE([test for Libsv library failed])])
AC_CHECK_HEADERS([semver.h],,
  [AC_MSG_FAILURE([test for Libsv header failed])])
@end example

@c page
@node semver
@chapter Semantic versioning


A @dfn{version} is described by the @samp{v2.0.0} specification found
at:

@center @url{http://semver.org/}

A leading @samp{v} character is stripped off and ignored.

@c page
@node semver ranges
@section Ranges


A @dfn{version range} is a set of @dfn{comparators} which specify
versions that satisfy the range.  A comparator is composed of an
@dfn{operator} and a @dfn{version}.  The set of primitive operators is:

@table @code
@item <
Less than.

@item <=
Less than or equal to.

@item >
Greater than.

@item >=
Greater than or equal to.

@item =
Equal.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed, so this
operator is optional, but MAY be included.
@end table

For example, the comparator @samp{>=1.2.7} would match the versions
@samp{1.2.7}, @samp{1.2.8}, @samp{2.5.3}, and @samp{1.3.9}, but not the
versions @samp{1.2.6} or @samp{1.1.0}.

Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a @dfn{comparator set},
which is satisfied by the @strong{intersection} of all of the
comparators it includes.

A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by @code{||}.
A version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the @code{||}--separated comparator sets is satisfied by the
version.

For example, the range @samp{>=1.2.7 <1.3.0} would match the versions
@samp{1.2.7}, @samp{1.2.8}, and @samp{1.2.99}, but not the versions
@samp{1.2.6}, @samp{1.3.0}, or @samp{1.1.0}.

The range @samp{1.2.7 || >=1.2.9 <2.0.0} would match the versions
@samp{1.2.7}, @samp{1.2.9}, and @samp{1.4.6}, but not the versions
@samp{1.2.8} or @samp{2.0.0}.

@c page
@node semver tags
@section Prerelease tags


If a version has a prerelease tag (for example @samp{1.2.3-alpha.3})
then it will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one
comparator with the same @code{(major, minor, patch)} tuple also has a
prerelease tag.

For example, the range @samp{>1.2.3-alpha.3} would be allowed to match
the version @samp{1.2.3-alpha.7}, but it would @strong{not} be satisfied
by @samp{3.4.5-alpha.9}, even though @samp{3.4.5-alpha.9} is technically
``greater than'' @samp{1.2.3-alpha.3} according to the Semantic
Versioning sort rules.  The version range only accepts prerelease tags
on the @samp{1.2.3} version.  The version @samp{3.4.5} @strong{would}
satisfy the range, because it does not have a prerelease tag, and
@samp{3.4.5} is greater than @samp{1.2.3-alpha.7}.

The purpose for this behavior is twofold.

@itemize
@item
Prerelease versions frequently are updated very quickly, and contain
many breaking changes that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for
public consumption.  Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range
matching semantics.

@item
A user who has opted into using a prerelease version has clearly
indicated the intent to use @strong{that specific} set of alpha/beta/rc
versions.  By including a prerelease tag in the range, the user is
indicating that they are aware of the risk.  However, it is still not
appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a similar risk on
the @strong{next} set of prerelease versions.
@end itemize

@c page
@node semver advanced
@section Advanced range syntax


Advanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in deterministic
ways.  Advanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive
comparators using white space or @code{||}.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Hyphen ranges @samp{X.Y.Z - A.B.C}


Specifies an inclusive set.

@table @asis
@item @samp{1.2.3 - 2.3.4} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4}
@end table

If a partial version is provided as the first version in the inclusive
range, then the missing pieces are replaced with zeroes.

@table @asis
@item @samp{1.2 - 2.3.4} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <=2.3.4}
@end table

If a partial version is provided as the second version in the inclusive
range, then all versions that start with the supplied parts of the tuple
are accepted, but nothing that would be greater than the provided tuple
parts.

@table @asis
@item @samp{1.2.3 - 2.3} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <2.4.0}

@item @samp{1.2.3 - 2} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <3.0.0}
@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading X-Ranges @samp{1.2.x} @samp{1.X} @samp{1.2.*} @samp{*}


Any of @samp{X}, @samp{x}, or @samp{*} may be used to ``stand in'' for
one of the numeric values in the @code{(major, minor, patch)} tuple.

@table @asis
@item @samp{*} := @samp{>=0.0.0}
Any version satisfies.

@item @samp{1.x} := @samp{>=1.0.0 <2.0.0}
Matching major version.

@item @samp{1.2.x} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <1.3.0}
Matching major and minor versions.
@end table

A partial version range is treated as an X-Range, so the special
character is in fact optional.

@table @asis
@item Empty string := @samp{*} := @samp{>=0.0.0}

@item @samp{1} := @samp{1.x.x} := @samp{>=1.0.0 <2.0.0}

@item @samp{1.2} := @samp{1.2.x} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <1.3.0}
@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Tilde ranges @samp{~1.2.3} @samp{~1.2} @samp{~1}

Allows patch--level changes if a minor version is specified on the
comparator.  Allows minor-level changes if not.

@table @asis
@item @samp{~1.2.3} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <1.3.0}

@item @samp{~1.2} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <1.(2+1).0} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <1.3.0}
Same as @samp{1.2.x}.

@item @samp{~1} := @samp{>=1.0.0 <(1+1).0.0} := @samp{>=1.0.0 <2.0.0}
Same as @samp{1.x}.

@item @samp{~0.2.3} := @samp{>=0.2.3 <0.(2+1).0} := @samp{>=0.2.3 <0.3.0}

@item @samp{~0.2} := @samp{>=0.2.0 <0.(2+1).0} := @samp{>=0.2.0 <0.3.0}
Same as @samp{0.2.x}.

@item @samp{~0} := @samp{>=0.0.0 <(0+1).0.0} := @samp{>=0.0.0 <1.0.0}
Same as @samp{0.x}.

@item @samp{~1.2.3-beta.2} := @samp{>=1.2.3-beta.2 <1.3.0}
Note that prereleases in the @samp{1.2.3} version will be allowed, if
they are greater than or equal to @samp{beta.2}.  So,
@samp{1.2.3-beta.4} would be allowed, but @samp{1.2.4-beta.2} would not,
because it is a prerelease of a different @code{(major, minor, patch)}
tuple.
@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Caret ranges @samp{^1.2.3} @samp{^0.2.5} @samp{^0.0.4}


Allow changes that do not modify the left--most non--zero digit in the
@code{(major, minor, patch)} tuple.  In other words, this allows patch
and minor updates for versions @samp{1.0.0} and above, patch updates for
versions @samp{0.X >=0.1.0}, and @strong{no} updates for versions
@samp{0.0.X}.

Many authors treat a @samp{0.x} version as if the @samp{x} were the
major ``breaking change'' indicator.

Caret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes between
@samp{0.2.4} and @samp{0.3.0} releases, which is a common practice.
However, it presumes that there will @strong{not} be breaking changes
between @samp{0.2.4} and @samp{0.2.5}.  It allows for changes that are
presumed to be additive (but non--breaking), according to commonly
observed practices.

@table @asis
@item @samp{^1.2.3} := @samp{>=1.2.3 <2.0.0}

@item @samp{^0.2.3} := @samp{>=0.2.3 <0.3.0}

@item @samp{^0.0.3} := @samp{>=0.0.3 <0.0.4}

@item @samp{^1.2.3-beta.2} := @samp{>=1.2.3-beta.2 <2.0.0}
Note that prereleases in the @samp{1.2.3} version will be allowed, if
they are greater than or equal to @samp{beta.2}.  So,
@samp{1.2.3-beta.4} would be allowed, but @samp{1.2.4-beta.2} would not,
because it is a prerelease of a different @code{(major, minor, patch)}
tuple.

@item @samp{^0.0.3-beta} := @samp{>=0.0.3-beta <0.0.4}
Note that prereleases in the @samp{0.0.3} version @strong{only} will be
allowed, if they are greater than or equal to @samp{beta}.  So,
@samp{0.0.3-pr.2} would be allowed.
@end table

When parsing caret ranges, a missing @code{patch} value desugars to the
number @samp{0}, but will allow flexibility within that value, even if
the major and minor versions are both @samp{0}.

@table @asis
@item @samp{^1.2.x} := @samp{>=1.2.0 <2.0.0}

@item @samp{^0.0.x} := @samp{>=0.0.0 <0.1.0}

@item @samp{^0.0} := @samp{>=0.0.0 <0.1.0}
@end table

A missing @code{minor} and @code{patch} values will desugar to zero, but
also allow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is
zero.

@table @asis
@item @samp{^1.x} := @samp{>=1.0.0 <2.0.0}

@item @samp{^0.x} := @samp{>=0.0.0 <1.0.0}
